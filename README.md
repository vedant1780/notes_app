## 🧪 How It Works

- `HomePage` loads all notes from the local database using `DBHelper`.
- A `FloatingActionButton` opens a modal bottom sheet for creating new notes.
- Edit and delete icons allow inline modification of notes.
- `DBHelper` manages all CRUD operations with SQLite.
- The UI refreshes using `setState()` after any data change.
